I have decided to scrape data for the New York Metro area from OpenStreetMaps.org. This is because I am a native New Yorker and have lived here for 24 years.
I would love to delve into cleaning the details surrounding it as I would recognize how to clean it thoroughly. Furthermore, it is quite a large file
so it is quite a challenge.
